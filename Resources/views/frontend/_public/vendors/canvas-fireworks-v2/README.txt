A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/ppmathis/pen/uBkIn.

 Improved version of my Canvas Fireworks snippet. Now features a lot of configuration possibilities (feel free to play with them) and some pretty neat looking particles.

As within the first version, you can click on the canvas to manually spawn a rocket - and by holding down your left mouse button, you can even draw whole 'lines'. See for yourself.
